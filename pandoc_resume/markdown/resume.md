Experience
--------------------

**Research Assistant**

UCLA Micro and Nano Manufacturing Lab *(June 2017 - August 2017)*

* Built high-resolution DXF to PDF file converter for circuit manufacturing website
* Helped create interface between laptop and boat speedometer for lab experiments

**Robotics Team Founder**

Founded high school VEX robotics team

* Taught STEM topics(basic programming, practical physics, etc) to high school students
* Started team, mentored students, developed website, raised funding

Technical Projects
----------

**Berryboy*(C)*** 

Gameboy emulator running in a baremetal environment

* Executes Gameboy ROMs by emulating the Gameboy CPU, GPU, Interrupt mechanism, and I/O
* Runs in baremetal(OS-free) Raspberry Pi environment with custom controller driver, use of GPIO interrupts, and manual framebuffer manipulation

**Comper*(C++)***

Jazz backing track generator from chord progression and context-free-grammar based style file

* Generates a drum track, a walking bassline, and piano chord playing with jazz voicings
* Implemented grammar parser, music generation logic, midi file generation, and music-specific data structures

**FPL Team Generator*(Python)***

Fantasy Premier League(FPL) team selection algorithm([dghosef.me/fpl-writeup](https://dghosef.me/fpl-writeup))

* Scraped soccer player statistics from the FPL API and saved in Pandas dataframe
* Developed algorithm to predict future player performances based on past performances, upcoming fixture difficulty, etc
* Utilized linear programming solver to maximize predicted future performance levels under constraints of FPL rules to build team
