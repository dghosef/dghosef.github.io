## Hi all
Joseph Tan here. I enjoy making computers do cool stuff, playing the piano and guitar, all things soccer, and messing around with my two wonderful dogs. I'm currently studying computer science at Stanford University. [Here](dghosef.github.io/I-have-not-made-a-resume-yet-but-i-will-soon-and-will-post-it-here) is a link to my resume.

## Projects

### [Comper](https://github.com/dghosef/comper)
An automatic backing track generator for jazz music. Takes in a style file using a custom context-free-grammar-like syntax file and a chord progression file and generates a walking bassline, comping with voice leading, and a simple drum track.

### [Fantasy Premier League Team Generator](https://github.com/dghosef/FPL-team-generator)
Scrapes data from [fplreview](https://fplreview.com/) and uses linear programming to generate an optimal Fantasy Premier League team. Currently a work in progress but should be ready by the start of next season.

## Other cool stuff

### [Dotfiles](https://github.com/dghosef/dotfiles)
The dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup that I spent way too long messing around with. Includes my i3, (neo)vim, and tmux config files.

### [TIFU](https://www.amazon.com/TIFU-Mortifying-confessions-internet-community-ebook/dp/B081Z794ZD/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tifu&qid=1608609736&s=books&sr=1-1)
Back in High School, I took a bunch of stories of people making funny mistakes from [r/tifu](https://reddit.com/r/tifu), compiled them into a book(with permission of the original authors of course) and self-published it onto Amazon. I used the pen name Benjamin Success just because. It's sales numbers have been abysmal, but now I can say I am a published author, which is a win in my books.
