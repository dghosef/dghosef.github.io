## Hi all
Joe here. I enjoy making computers do stuff, playing the piano and guitar, all things soccer, and messing around with my [two wonderful sausage dogs](dogs.jpg). I'm currently studying computer science at Stanford University where I also TA CS106A, CS106B, and CS140E.

## Open Source & Research Contributions

### [Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
A few other members of the Julia community and I added support for
callsite inline/noinline annotations to the Julia compiler. This
allows for finer control over optimizations when writing Julia programs.

### [PochiVM + TACO Compiler](http://tensor-compiler.org/)
[PochiVM](https://github.com/sillycross/PochiVM) is a research 
JIT code-generation framework that comes with an extremely fast baseline compiler. 
I rewrote the backend of the [Tensor Algebra Compiler(TACO)](http://tensor-compiler.org/)
to use PochiVM and saw compilation performances of TACO increase by a factor of up to 100x.
I then modified the baseline compiler to recognize common patterns in TACO's generated code and
specialize compilation for them, allowing TACO to have an extremely fast baseline compiler that
still produces high performing kernels.

## Technical Projects

### [qdbp](http://qdbplang.org/)
No general purpose programming language is perfect, but qdbp is as close as it gets
in my (completely unbiased) opinion. It is simple, expressive, safe, and with
a little more work can be relatively performant.

### [Driver-Language](https://github.com/dghosef/driver-language)
Writing drivers is hard. The process often consists of reading dense
documentation littered with errors and writing low level C. This project
is a domain specific language designed to make driver development easier.
The language itself has a simple - albeit limited - imperative core with
variables, memory reads, and memory writes with which users can write drivers.
In addition, users also provide a specification that the compiler checks the driver
against. In the specification, the user can provide rules for properties drivers
must have such as, for example, the order in which
registers have to be written, and the compiler verifies that the driver follows those rules statically.

### [Berryboy](berryboy.jpg)
A gameboy emulator for a baremetal Raspberry Pi environment that I
developed with a fellow student. It reads a Gameboy ROM file and emulates
the ppu(gpu), cpu, interrupt mechanism, and I/O. Because it runs on
the Pi without an OS, it also comes with drivers for Raspberry Pi
hardware such as GPIO and the framebuffer.

### [Fantasy Premier League Team Generator](https://github.com/dghosef/FPL-team-generator)

Automated [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com)
team generation. It predicts English professional soccer player
performances using statistics from the official Premier League API and
a player/team performance modeling algorithm I developed. With those
predictions and the python [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/)
linear programming library, it assembles a Fantasy Premier League team.

### [Comper](https://github.com/dghosef/comper)
An automatic backing track generator for jazz music. It takes in a style
file that uses a custom context-free-grammar-like DSL and a chord
progression file and generates a midi file consisting of a walking
bassline, comping with voice leading, and a simple drum track.

## Other


### [VEX Robotics](https://heritage-schools.org/academics/robotics/)

I founded a VEX robotics team a few years back, managed to teach a
variety of STEM topics to high school students(coding, practical
physics, etc), and had a blast. I am not nearly as active in the team
anymore(I handed it off to one of the staff at the school) but I still
help out from time to time. [Team

### Internships

I've interned at [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) and [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) in the past.
At NASA, I developed language tooling(auto complete, syntax highlighting, error squiggles, etc) for 
the [Ingenuity Helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/)'s command language. And at
Roblox, I built a unit testing framework for the game engine tests and migrated the unit test suite
over to my framework.
