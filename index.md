## Hi all
Joseph Tan here. I enjoy making computers do cool stuff, playing the piano and guitar, all things soccer, and messing around with my [two wonderful wiener dogs](dogs.jpg). I'm currently studying computer science at Stanford University. [Resume](resume.pdf)

## Technical Projects

### [Comper](https://github.com/dghosef/comper)
An automatic backing track generator for jazz music. Takes in a style file using a custom context-free-grammar-like syntax file and a chord progression file and generates a midi file consisting of a walking bassline, comping with voice leading, and a simple drum track. [Samples](https://soundcloud.com/joseph-tan-486477918/sets/automatically-generated-backing-tracks) - [Github](https://github.com/dghosef/comper)

### [Fantasy Premier League Team Generator](https://github.com/dghosef/FPL-team-generator)
Scrapes data from [fplreview](https://fplreview.com/) and uses linear programming to generate a Fantasy Premier League team. Currently a work in progress but should be ready by the start of next season. [Github](https://github.com/dghosef/FPL-team-generator)

## Other Projects

### [Dotfiles](https://github.com/dghosef/dotfiles)
The dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup that I spend way too much time messing around with. Includes my i3, (neo)vim, and tmux config files among others. [Github](https://github.com/dghosef/dotfiles)

### [TIFU](https://www.amazon.com/TIFU-Mortifying-confessions-internet-community-ebook/dp/B081Z794ZD/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tifu&qid=1608609736&s=books&sr=1-1)
Back in High School, I took a bunch of stories of people making funny mistakes from [r/tifu](https://reddit.com/r/tifu), compiled them into a book(with the permission of the original authors of course), and self-published it onto Amazon under the pen name Benjamin Success. Its sales numbers have been abysmal, but now I can say I am a published author, which is a win in my books. Any proceeds go to [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), a charity that gives money directly to those in need in the USA and the African nations of Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, and Kibera.

### [VEX Robotics](https://heritage-schools.org/academics/robotics/)
I founded a VEX robotics team a few years back, managed to teach a variety of STEM topics to high school students(coding, practical physics, etc), and had a blast. I am not nearly as active in the team anymore(I handed it off to one of the staff at the school) but I still help out from time to time.
