## Hi all
Joseph here. I enjoy making computers do cool stuff, watching/playing soccer(go Southampton!), playing the piano and guitar, and messing around with my two wonderful dogs. I'm currently studying computer science at Stanford University. 

## Projects
[comper](https://github.com/dghosef/comper) An automatic backing track generator for jazz music. Takes in a style file using a custom context-free-grammar-like syntax and a chord progression file and generates a walking bassline, comping with voice leading, and a simple drum track.
[Fantasy Premier League Team Generator](https://github.com/dghosef/FPL-team-generator)
